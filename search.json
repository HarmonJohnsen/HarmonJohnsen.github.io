    "text": "Hello! I’m Harmon Johnsen!\nI’m a sports broadcaster, camera operator, news producer, and a whole lot more in the media industry. I am currently a junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s College of Journalism and Mass Communications.\nAs a play-by-play broadcaster, I have been on the air for numerous games across multiple sports on 90.3 KRNU and KRNU 2, the student radio stations, as well as a freelancer on Big Ten Plus. I spent the summer of 2025 in Yakima, Washington as the play-by-play voice and media manager of the Yakima Valley Pippins baseball team, a summer collegiate wood-bat team in the West Coast League.\nI work for HuskerVision HD as a member of the support staff (running cameras, working in the control room). I have been a part of in-venue big screen shows for football, volleyball, and men’s and women’s basketball. I also have been on cameras for Big Ten Plus productions of volleyball, soccer, softball, and baseball.\nI was a student lead for Nebraska Nightly, the CoJMC’s student-run television newscast. I produced newscasts for our 15-minute Tuesday and 30-minute Friday shows, as well as anchored, directed, and instructed fellow students how to operate a newsroom. I learned most of what I needed to know during my MMJ Internship at KNOP News 2 during the summer of 2024."
